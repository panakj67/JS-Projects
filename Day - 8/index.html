<!-- 1). we have 3 cars car1, car2 and car3(c1 <- c2 <- c3) if we give position absolute to any of the car let say(car1)
then the car1 lifts up to a layer(say layer 1) and the vaccant space is taken by the remaining car
if we apply position absolute to car2 then car2 lifts up to a upper layer than layer1(say layer2)
and the vacc space is taken by car3, and if we apply position absolute to car3 then it lifts upto the top layer(say layer3)

---------- : layer3
---------- : layer2
---------- : layer1

2). when we provide css property (position) to any element then 5 properties (left, right, top, bottom, z-index)
is activated, for any css property element takes the space from top-left corner so we apply
transform translate(-50% ,-50%) means shifting 50% width to left and 50% height ro up

By default the z-index is 1, it can have value upto 999999999, the greater z-index have upper layer

3). lets suppose we have a div (say bg) and we have another div (say pod) inside it so the pod div can move to anywhere inside
the parent div but if apply position absolute to it, now it can move anywhere on the screen but if we want to lift the pod div
but we restrict it inside the parent div then we have to apply position relative to parent div -->
